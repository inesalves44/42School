## The School
42 School, also known as Ã‰cole 42, is an innovative coding institution founded by French entrepreneur Xavier Niel in 2013. It stands out with its tuition-free model and project-centered approach to teaching software engineering. Named after a reference in "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," 42 School promotes peer-to-peer learning and independent study. The curriculum focuses on hands-on projects, utilizing gamification for skill enhancement through increasingly intricate coding challenges. Notably, the admission process, known as the Piscine, assesses candidates' coding prowess.

The "piscine" is a unique and intense coding bootcamp-style program offered by 42 School. The term "piscine" is French for "swimming pool," which metaphorically refers to diving into a challenging and immersive learning experience. During the piscine, participants, often prospective students of 42 School, are given a condensed period of time, typically a few weeks, to fully immerse themselves in coding and problem-solving tasks.

The piscine serves as an entry point and selection process for 42 School's full curriculum. It's designed to evaluate candidates' coding skills, determination, and ability to handle the rigorous and collaborative learning style that 42 School employs. The challenges presented during the piscine range in complexity, requiring participants to work on various coding projects and exercises.

Participating in the piscine is a way for candidates to showcase their coding abilities, learn about 42 School's unique learning environment, and earn a spot in the full program if they successfully complete the challenges and demonstrate the required aptitude.

<summary>Common Core</summary>
At 42 School, the Common Core is a set of programming projects and challenges that serve as a common starting point for all students. It ensures that everyone develops a baseline proficiency in coding and problem-solving skills before moving on to more specialized areas of study. The Common Core is designed to help students familiarize themselves with the school's unique project-based learning model and to create a level playing field for diverse learners.

Completing the Common Core demonstrates a student's ability to grasp fundamental coding concepts and effectively collaborate with peers, which are essential skills for success in 42 School's self-directed learning environment. After completing the Common Core, students have the freedom to explore more advanced projects and topics based on their interests and goals within the school's broader curriculum.
